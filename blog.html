										<strong>Local storage :</strong> Local storage is available in the browser to
										all windows with the same origin (domain). Data stored in the local storage is
										also available after the window has been closed. The next time a window is
										opened and loads the page from the same origin, the page can access the stored
										values there again.
									</p>
									<p>
										<strong>Session storage :</strong> Session storage is available inside the same
										browser window for as long as the window is open. When the browser window is
										closed, the session storage associated with that window is deleted. Multiple
										windows from the same origin (URL) cannot see each others session storage. Popup
										windows opened from the same window can see session storage, and so can iframes
										inside the same window.

										<strong>Global scope :</strong> Global scope contains all of the things defined
										outside of all code blocks. A code block simply consists of grouped statements
										inside curly braces ({ }). if statement, loops, function are examples of
										structure that create a code block. A global variable has global scope. A global
										variable is accessible from anywhere in the code.
									</p>
									<p>
										<strong>Block scope :</strong> Block Level Scope: This scope restricts the
										variable that is declared inside a specific block, from access by the outside of
										the block. The <code>let</code> & <code>const</code> keyword facilitates the
										variables to be block scoped.

										<strong>Event Loop :</strong> Each message is processed completely before any
										other message is processed. This offers some nice properties when reasoning
										about your program, including the fact that whenever a function runs, it cannot
										be preempted and will run entirely before any other code runs (and can modify
										data the function manipulates). This differs from C, for instance, where if a
										function runs in a thread, it may be stopped at any point by the runtime system
										to run some other code in another thread.
									</p>
									<p>
										A downside of this model is that if a message takes too long to complete, the
										web application is unable to process user interactions like click or scroll. The
										browser mitigates this with the "a script is taking too long to run" dialog. A
										good practice to follow is to make message processing short and if possible cut
										down one message into several messages.

										<strong>Undefined :</strong> Each message is processed undefined is a property
										of the global object. That is, it is a variable in global scope. The initial
										value of undefined is the primitive value undefined.
									</p>
									<p>
										In all non-legacy browsers, undefined is a non-configurable, non-writable
										property. (Even when this is not the case, avoid overriding it.)
									</p>
									<p>
										A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type <code>undefined</code>.
										A method or statement also returns <code>undefined</code> if the variable that
										is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns
										<code>undefined</code> if a value was not returned.
